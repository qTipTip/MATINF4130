# MATINF4130

Mandatory assignments in the course MATINF4130 - Numerical Linear Algebra at the University of Oslo.

## Assignment 1

We examine numerical routines related to the solution of triangular linear systems. We perform some rudimentary run time analysis for a
simple inversion algorithm for triangular matrices. An implementation in Python of the algorithm is included. 

## Assignment 2

In this assignment, we implement and compare three different algorithms for the solution of linear systems: Gaussian elimination, Gaussian elimination with pivoting; and Householder triangulation. Again, some rudimentary run time and time complexity analysis is performed. Source code is included. 

## Assignment 3

We derive and examine two algorithms for the least square minimization problem. Again the implementations are done in Python. 

## Assignment 4

In this assigment, we implement Google's PageRank algorithm, and run simulations on a small dummy-network.
